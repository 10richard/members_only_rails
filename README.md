# README

Practice with user auth and sessions. Allow the user to create posts only if they are signed in. Change the display of the posts based on if the user is signed in or not (if user is not signed in, then author of the post will be hidden).

The website is extremely ugly, but oh well we move
¯\_(ツ)_/¯
